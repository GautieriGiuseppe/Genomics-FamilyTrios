# Genomics-FamilyTrios

Workflow of Genomics analysis of Rare mendelian diseases in simulated data in family trios.

## Project Background

The project is part of examination process of Genomics and Trascriptomics course within the Master's degree in Bioinformatics for Computational Genomics at UniMi and at Polimi. The objective of the course is to introduce the fundamentals of modern analysis in genomics and transcriptomics, using Unix and the most relevant and widely used approaches to the bioinformatic analysis of data derived from the sequencing of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA).

## Project Overview

This project involves the analysis of simulated genome sequencing data, specifically exome sequencing, to identify rare genetic disorders in 10 individuals.
The goal is to achieve a molecular diagnosis through the use of bioinformatics tools and variant interpretation workflows. The analysis is focused only on chr16, fot the detailed report check ###link###.
